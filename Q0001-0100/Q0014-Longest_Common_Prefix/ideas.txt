Iterate through the strings [S0â€¦Sn], finding at each iteration i the longest common prefix of
strings LCP(S0,Si). When LCP(S0,Si) is an empty string, the algorithm ends. Otherwise after n
iterations, the algorithm returns LCP(S0, Sn-1).


Time complexity : O(S) , where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.
Space complexity: O(1).
