two passes solution:
1. Use binary search to find the pivot where the array is rotated.
2. Do binary search on the left side or right side to find the target.

Time complexity: O(logN).
Space complexity: O(1).

two passes solution:
The basic idea is to combine both round of binary search into one. We do it by combining the
condition checks together.

Time complexity: O(logN).
Space complexity: O(1).
