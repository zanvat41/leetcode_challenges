1. Add to the output all the intervals starting before newInterval.

2. Add to the output newInterval. Merge it with the last added interval if newInterval starts before the last added interval.

3. Add the next intervals one by one. Merge with the last added interval if the current interval starts before the last added interval.

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1) not counting the space used to hold result. (O(N) to keep the result.)
