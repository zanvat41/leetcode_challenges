For every number in the matrix, all numbers on the same row on its left is smaller than itself;
all numbers on the same column below it is larger than itself.
So do search starting from top right position.

Time complexity: O(m+n).
Space complexity: O(1).

Otherwise, we can do some math on the indices and make the matrix a sorted array,
then do binary search. Time complexity will be O(log(mn))=O(logm+logn) for this.
