Two Passes Solution:
First pass, count the appearances of the three numbers.
Second pass, rewrite the array.

One Pass Solution:
Algorithm 1:
Expand 0's boundary from left to right, expand 2's boundary from right to left.

Algorithm 2:
Add the current number to the first position of its group by moving everything
after it one position backward.


Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).
