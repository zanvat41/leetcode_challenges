Inorder traversal of BST is an array sorted in the ascending order. So we just need to do:

1. Construct inorder traversal of the tree. It should be an almost sorted list where only two elements are swapped.

2. Identify two swapped elements x and y in an almost sorted array in linear time.

3. Traverse the tree again. Change value x to y and value y to x.


Time and Space Complexity: O(N).
