Count size solution:
Go through the list once and get the size. Then remove the (size-n)th node.

Time complexity: O(N).
Space complexity: O(1).

1 pass solution:
Use 2 pointers. The first pointer is n nodes aways from the second one.
Keep moving both pointers one by one until the first pointer is pointing to null node.
Then do remove second.next.

Time complexity: O(N).
Space complexity: O(1).
