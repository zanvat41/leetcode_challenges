itSolution:
Pairing up the k lists, and merge the pairs. Then repeat.
For example, we have l1, l2, l3, l4, l5.
We first merge l1 and l2 to become nl1, merge l2 and l3 to be nl2, and make l5 nl3.
Then we have nl1, nl2, nl3. We just need to repeat the last step.

Time complexity: O(Nlogk).
Space complexity: O(1).

recSolution:
Do divide and conquer.
Split the original k lists to left and right part.
Then merge the left and right part separately to have left merged list and right merged list.
Then we merge left merged list and right merged list.

Time complexity: O(Nlogk).
Space complexity: O(N).
