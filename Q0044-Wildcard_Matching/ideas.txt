When we see a '*', assume "matches zero characters" and proceed p further.
If this assumption would lead in "no match" situation, then backtrack :
come back to the '*', assume now that it matches one character and proceed again.
Again "no match" situation? Backtrack again...

Time complexity: O(SP)
Space complexity: O(1)
