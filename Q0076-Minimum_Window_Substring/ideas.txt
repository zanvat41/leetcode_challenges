Eexpand and contract the window using the two pointers and keep checking the window for all the characters.

L ------------------------ R , Suppose this is the window that contains all characters of T

        L----------------- R , this is the contracted window. We found a smaller window that still contains all the characters in T

When the window is no longer valid, start expanding again using the right pointer.


Time complexity: O(m + n).
Space complexity: O(m + n).
