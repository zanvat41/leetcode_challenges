For a current node, we will check if it has a left child or not.
If it does, we will find the last node in the rightmost branch of the subtree rooted at this left child.
Once we find this "rightmost" node, we will hook it up with the right child of the current node.


Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).
