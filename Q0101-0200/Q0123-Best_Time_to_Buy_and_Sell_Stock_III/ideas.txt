DP Solution:
Since you have to finish the first sell transaction before you perform the second buy transaction,
the max profit would be maxProfit(prices[0...i])+maxProfit(prices[i+1....n) for some i.
So we are having 2 dp arrays,
leftProfits[0...n] keeps track of the first transaction;
rightProfits[0...n] keeps track of the second transaction.

Time and Space Complexity: O(N).



One Pass Solution:
At the beginning, you have $0 in your account.
After each day, you might be in each of the five states:
1. You did nothing yet.
2. You completed the first buying transaction. Then your account have $"buy1".
3. You completed the first selling transaction. Then your account have $"sell1".
4. You completed the second buying transaction. Then your account have $"buy2".
5. You completed the second selling transaction. Then your account have $"sell2".

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).
