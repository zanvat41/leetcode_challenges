First, we mark the first index as start position and perform the road trip.
We use curTank to keep track of the status from start position to ith position.
We use totalTank to keep track of the status from 1st position to nth position.
When we encounter a situation that curTank < 0, it means the current start position is invalid.
Then we need to update the start position and reset curTank.

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).
