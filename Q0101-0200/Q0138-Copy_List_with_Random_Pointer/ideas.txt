Hash Map Solution:
1. Iterate the original list, on each step, build the copied node, connect next pointer,
and put the original node and the copied node in hash map.
2. Iterate the original list and the copied list again, then connect the random pointer
with the help of the hash map.

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).


Constant Space Solution:
1. Iterate the original list, on each step, build the copied node, and put it after the original list.
2. Iterate the modified original list, on each step, connect the random pointer of the copied node.
3. Split the list.

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).
