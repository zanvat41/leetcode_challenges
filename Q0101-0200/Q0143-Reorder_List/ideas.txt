Solution 1:
Use list to store the nodes in order. Then use left and right pointer to iterate the list and connect nodes.

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(N).


Solution 2:
Reverse the second half of the list. Then merge the first half and second half.

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).
