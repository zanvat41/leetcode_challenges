Time complexity : O(N) in the worst case when string lengths are close enough abs(ns - nt) <= 1,
where N is a number of characters in the longest string. O(1) in the best case when abs(ns - nt) > 1.

Space complexity : O(N) because strings are immutable in Java and to create substring costs O(N) space.
