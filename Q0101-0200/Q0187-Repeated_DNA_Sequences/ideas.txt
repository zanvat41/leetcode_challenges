A simple solution is to use a hash map to count the appearance of each substring of length 10.

However, we can also used the idea of rolling hash and bit manipulation to calculate the hash code by ourselves.

Time complexity : O(N−L), that is O(N) for the constant L = 10.
In the loop executed N−L+1 one builds a bitmask in a constant time, that results in O(N−L) time complexity.

Space complexity : O(N−L) to keep the hashset, that results in O(N) for the constant L = 10.
