Since 0&(1or0) = 0, we just need to find the common prefix of both numbers.

Time Complexity: O(1).Although there is a loop in the algorithm, the number of iterations is bounded by the number of bits that an integer has, which is fixed.
Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is constant.

Space Complexity: O(1). The consumption of the memory for our algorithm is constant, regardless the input.
