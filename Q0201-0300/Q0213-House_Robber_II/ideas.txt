Since House[1] and House[n] are adjacent, they cannot be robbed together.
Therefore, the problem becomes to rob either House[1]-House[n-1] or House[2]-House[n], depending on which choice offers more money.
Now the problem has degenerated to the Q198-House Robber.

Time Complexity: O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1).
