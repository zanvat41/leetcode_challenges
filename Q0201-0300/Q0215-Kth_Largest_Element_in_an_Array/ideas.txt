Method 1 Brute force:
Loop through the array k times/

Time Complexity: O(KN).
Space Complexity: O(1).

Method 2 Sorting:
Time Complexity: O(NlogN).
Space Complexity: O(logN).

Method 3 Heap:
Stored the largest k numbers in a heap.

Time Complexity: O(NlogK).
Space Complexity: O(K).

Method 4 Quick Select:
Keep finding a random pivot and partition correctly until we get a pivot that is in kth position from the right.

Time complexity : O(N) in the average case, O(N^2) in the worst case.
Space complexity : O(1).
