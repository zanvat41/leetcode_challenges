Use a HashSet as sliding window, to keep numbers from nums[i-k] to nums[i].

Time complexity : O(n). We do n operations of search, delete and insert, each with constant time complexity.

Space complexity : O(min(n,k)). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the HashSet, which is the size of the sliding window, min(n,k).
