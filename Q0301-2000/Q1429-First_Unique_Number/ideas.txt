Use queue and hashmap.

Let K be the length of the initial array passed into the constructor.

Let N be the total number of items added onto the queue so far (including those from the constructor).

Time complexity: O(K) for FirstUnique, O(N) or O(1) for showFirstUnique, O(1) for add.
Space complexity : O(N).
