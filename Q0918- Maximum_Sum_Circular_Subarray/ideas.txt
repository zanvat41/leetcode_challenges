The maximum "normal sum" is the Maximum Subarray problem which can be found with Kadane's.
This case we can refer to Q53.

And the second case is that the "special sum" as the sum of a prefix and a suffix,
there is a subarray that we don't want in the middle.
This is the sum of all elements, minus a subarray in the middle.
In this case, we want to minimize this middle subarray's sum, which we can calculate using Kadane's algorithm as well.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
